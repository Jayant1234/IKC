# IKC

## Mission 
To organize knowledge efficiently through collaboration to create deep intuitive understanding in AI, Deep Learning, required mathematics, Neuroscience with a singular focus on solving intelligence. 

## Goals

* To enable efficient learning by condensing knowledge in the right way in a single deeply connected Knolwedge Base
* To develop research aptitude in members. 
* To improve creativity, problem solving  by developing strong intuitive foundations. 
* Ambitious Goal1 : To develop understanding with depth and breadth that no one has ever achieved. 
* Ambitious Goal2 :-  All members produce new ground-breaking research within the field of AI, Deep Learning in their respective careers. 

# Approaches 
Following approaches will be taken towards building a common knowledge base : 
* 
### Building VISIONARY BRAIN

This is a Top to Bottom approach. We will try to develop understanding on how different subfields work on higher level of abstraction. This can help us create long term plans towards the problem of intelligence with a unique perspective and advantage. 
 * 
 ### Building EXPERT BRAIN 
 This is a bottom to top approach. We will follow a source material like DL book by Goodfellow to create a ground up understanding for Deep Learning. 
* 
### Combining Visionary + Expert BRAIN : Projects 
We will put all put projects together and try to dig deeper into their basics and at the same time think about the big picture for the concerned projects. This approach is for members who have quite limited time commitments for IKC. This approach is more in sync with course progression as well. 

## Technologies to Use : 
We will use github markdown files to combine links of Dropbox paper notes. Most of our Knowledge Base content will be in Dropbox paper.

## Tasks 
Each member will be assigned Tasks. Each member will get a chance to speak about their task for 2-3 minutes. Whereas, one member who has accomplished concept clarity and want to share with everyone can present for 20 minutes. There will be only one presentation slot per meeting. Rest of the time will be spent on future tasks or getting the tasks done in collaboration at the place of meeting.

## Next Meeting Tasks
