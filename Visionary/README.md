### Building VISIONARY BRAIN

This is a Top to Bottom approach. We will try to develop understanding on how different subfields work on higher level of abstraction. This can help us create long term plans towards the problem of intelligence with a unique perspective and advantage. 

We are starting with following sources at first and then will expand using their source material in different directions: 

* Possible Minds
* The architects of Intelligence
* Jeff Hawkins - On Intelligence.pdf
* the rise of robots.pdf
* The Industries of the Future - Alec Ross.pdf
* Artificial General Intelligence, Superintelligence, Intelligence Wikipedia articles

Probably after this, we will focus on field specific research papers and review papers. We will go over their introductions, related work and conclusions to draw a more clear picture. We will try to combine disparate views.
